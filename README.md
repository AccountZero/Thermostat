# Thermostat
This is code for an Arduino Thermostat

## Description
Old description: "This project was made for a school project, where it was required to create an arduino with a useful function. Had fun developing it and gave me first impressions on arduino. More project might follow..."
The old description describes actually, what that project is. I kind of never went above with the project, because for now at least i do not have any Arduino at my place... yet. I plan on getting Arduino.

## Further Progress ?
Has not that high priority for now, so it might take a while before i go full Arduino
