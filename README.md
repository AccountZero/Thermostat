# Thermostat
This is code for an Arduino Thermostat

## Description
Old description: "This project was made for a school project, where it was required to create an arduino with a useful function. Had fun developing it and gave me first impressions on arduino. More project might follow..."
The old description describes actually, what that project is. I kind of never went above with the project, because for now at least i do not have any Arduino at my place... yet. I plan on getting Arduino.

It looks like this:

I was 17 when i did the project, therefore there is no smart documentation about it... silly 17 year old me XD

## Further Progress ?
Since i do not really have any arduino and i am not really focused on arduino for now, it might take a while. On the other side i do not intend on deleting this repo... so something will happen. To be continued...
